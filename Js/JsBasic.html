    <!-- Scripting  :  A script is a Program that doesn't need pre-processing(i.e cmopiling) before being run.
        Js code is executed by the browser when a page is loaded, or in response to an event triggered by the user.

        Js is firstly invented for client side only but because of its numerous features it can be used in backend.
        Types of Script : 

        1. Client-side script       => which runs in client side machines (web browser)
        ex:   Js, VBScript, typescript, etc.

        2. Server-side script       => which runs in Server side machines
        ex : php, jsp, asp.net, VueScript, Express Script, nodeJS, cgi, perl, etc.


        1993    -   HTML
        1996    -   CSS
        1995    -   JS  released by Netscape(Mozilla) compny developer named "Brendan Eich".

        Mocha(1995) =>  Livescript  => JavaScript(1997-dec)

        Navigator2 is the first brwser which executed the Js.
        Mozile is the first browser used by the public.


        java => 23-jan-1996 jdk1.0


        later Js became an ECMAScript (European Computer Manufacturers Association Script).'
        0
        Js is implementation of ECMAScript;
        ECMAScript is the Specification of JavaScipt.
        ex. RBI => SBI , HDFC, ICICI -> Customer
            ES  =>  JS  => Programmer

        40% of concepts are filled with ECMAScrit and 60% of JS.




        Js Features :

        Speed, light weight, dynamic typed, loosely typed, extended functionality, cross platform ,Interoperability, Extended functionality , free ware and open-source.


        1. speed : js appln runs more faster than java, python ,....
        2. light weight : less code more operations.
        3. Interoperability : js they have the capability to work within other web technologies.
        4. Extended functionality  : we can use others developed libraries in the Js.
        5. dynamic typed : without declaring variable we can directly use it.
        6. loosely typed : defined any var in js, it can store any type of value.
        7. cross platform : cross platform compatible.

        => its single threaded programme       ==> we able to run only one task at a time.
        => js is an Object-based or prototype-based programming.

        ⇒ Js is Client side (browser-side) programming. That means it executes on the browser.


        ⇒ It can be used in Server-Side by using Node, ASP, PHP.

        ⇒ Js is a case Sesitive programme (mixed case).

        ⇒ no need to install any software to use JS.

        ⇒ Js is “Interpreter-Based” programming, means the code will be converted into machine language line by line. Js interpreter is already embedded in browsers.

- Parser  :
    
    Js code (high) ↔ Js parser ↔ machine code
    
    parser is responsible for translating js to machine code and machine code to js.
    

⇒ Js Engine :  (like JVM)

V8  → Chrome, Edge, Opera. (developed by Google)

Spider Monkey → Firefox

Charkra → IE

SquirrelFish → Safari

⇒ Js Used

web dev, mobile App, gaming, animations, AI, Networking app ,…

Html → Version 5

CSS → CSS3

Js → Version 6
