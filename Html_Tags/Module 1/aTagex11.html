	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>Tata Motors was founded in 1945, as a locomotive manufacturer. Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany in which Tata developed a manufacturing facility in Jamshedpur for Daimler lorries. By November 1954 Tata and Daimler manufactured their first goods carrier chassis at their Jamshedpur plant with 90-100 hp and capacity of 3-5 tons. After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a sport utility vehicle based on the Tata Mobile platform. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier Tata Mobile), the Tata Sumo (1994, a 5-door SUV) and the Tata Safari (1998).</p>

	<p>Tata launched the Indica in 1998. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, later appeared. Tata Motors also exported cars to South Africa.<br>

	<h3>History:</h3>
	<p>The Maruti name can be traced back to a previous company that was established by the third Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's son, Sanjay Gandhi. In the early 1970s, the Indian government initiated the search for a small car manufacturer. At that time, India had already been manufacturing cars for several years, and the idea of a more affordable "people's car" had been discussed since the 1950s.</p>

	<p>Sanjay Gandhi, known for his passion for cars, apprenticed with Rolls-Royce in Crewe, UK for three years. Upon his return in 1968, he recognized the potential of small car production in the private sector. Both the government and the Planning Commission endorsed the concept. Sanjay Gandhi subsequently initiated his automotive project, establishing operations in a rented garage near Roshanara Bagh in Old Delhi. Contrary to the previous belief, later revelations indicated he had earned only a relatively minor qualification in mechanical engineering.</p>
